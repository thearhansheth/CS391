                    <p>My name is Arhan, and I am a dual degree candidate at Boston University.
                        I am majoring in Computer Science and Business Administration(Concentrating in Finance).
                        My interests include swe, AI/ML, and data analysis. As a rising senior, I am weighing up
                        my options in both the industry and potentially, a master's degree to further my
                        academic and personal prowess.</p>
                    <p>Welcome to my website. Here you will find my Education and Work Experience details, as well as
